    <h1>The Site</h1>
    <h2>I am currently enrolled in WEB 105 at Mchenry County College</h2>
    <p>I am taking Web 105 so I can learn more about the basics when it comes to coding for websites.
        I never took a coding class before, my only experience with coding is in a book that I bought and never read yet.
        Although I learned some web coding from last semester when I took Computer Literacy for Windows. </p>
